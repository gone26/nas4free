- Encrypted user passwords in config.xml:
	It is not possible to use encrypted passwords in config.xml due to the following feature:
	'Services|Webserver' --> 'Authentication' --> 'Enable Authentication'. Because the script
	'/etc/rc.d/websrv_htpasswd' uses plain-text passwords to create an htpasswd file.
